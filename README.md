# AzureFunctionWDocker
This is a example of an Azure Function wrote in C#, it is about a simple exchange rate calculator, I send an Argentinian Pesos amount and expect the equal in Dollars(USD).
The aim of this example is just to give a simple and easy business case just to complement the full implementation of an Azure function running inside a Docker Container
